  <p class="text">Wikipedia defines a Voronoi diagram as "a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given
    set of objects." In other words, pick any point, imagine each pixel of color to be another point within that Voronoi
    Cell, each of those colored points are closest to the original point that we picked. And this is true for every
    point in the diagram.</p>

  <p class="text">A project for the Kaijujam II on itch.io. This was completed while I was a full-time student during
    one of
    my quarters as a side project to ease my mind. All the art was done by me and the programming was mainly done by
    moduls in <a href="https://www.gbstudio.dev/" target="_blank">GBStudio</a>.</p>
