  <img src="gifs/voronoi.gif">
  <p class="text">Wikipedia defines a Voronoi diagram as "a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given
    set of objects." In other words, pick any point, imagine each pixel of color to be another point within that Voronoi
    Cell, each of those colored points are closest to the original point that we picked. And this is true for every
    point in the diagram.</p>

  <p class="text">This code is from an assignment by Professor Bill Kerney at Clovis Community College completed by a fellow
      student and I. <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Whatahooda" target="_blank">@Whatahooda</a> on GitHub</p>
  
  <p class="text">This was written in C++ and implemented using the terminal. The colors library came from Professor Kerney 
    and was used to draw tiles onto the terminal screen.</p>

  <p class="text">A project for the Kaijujam II on itch.io. This was completed while I was a full-time student during
    one of
    my quarters as a side project to ease my mind. All the art was done by me and the programming was mainly done by
    modules in <a class="link" href="https://www.gbstudio.dev/" target="_blank">GBStudio</a>.</p>

  <p class="text">This project was developed in part by me, my former boss 
    David Lesser, a fellow programmer <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/13Ducks">Aaryan Agrawal</a>, 
    and a peer designer <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://sauljimenez.com/yo">Saul Jimenez</a>.
    For my role, when this project started I was tasked with developing it by myself,
    Aaryan came in later and helped add a few things, while Saul redesigned the entire things
    and created the images you see above. 
  </p>
  <p class="text">The intent of this project was to have a system that interfaced with a physical
    box, created by David, that utilized the RFID chip in a student ID card. The box would read in the 
    student's UUID on the card and we would then choose what to do afterwards. 
  </p>
  <p class="text"> If the student had an account and already signed our waiver, it would welcome them,
    if one of the two account or waiver was missing, it would prompt them accordingly.
    All of this is being checked through a series of Google Sheets API calls. The sheet
    acted as our database and allowed for staff to be able to modify accounts as needed without
    the need for SQL or any proper database.
  </p>
  <p class="text">If the user had no account, they could use the magswipe reader we had set up,
    and my code would read their ID number from their card and use a script, developed by David,
    to pull the user's information from the UCSD database. This would then get auto-filled
    and our system would prompt the user to ensure the information was correct and allow for adjustments.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    This whole project was developed mostly in python with the use of tkinter and figma for the GUI,
    Sheets as the database, C and C++ for the ESP-32 reading the ID cards, a USB magswipe, and all
    connected to a Raspberry Pi 400 so the users could type, and our monitor was touch screen.
  </p>
  <p class="text">I learned a great deal from this project, and also gained a major ability to design an entire
    system by myself, and have others come in and fix my mistakes of course. But otherwise I gained 
    a ton of confidence as a developer and feel that I am now able to tackle any coding challenge 
    that comes my way.
  </p>
  <p class="text">The code to all of this can be found here on GitHub:

  <h2 class="h2">2D Game Development</h2>
  <img src="gifs/gamedemo.gif">
  <p class="text">I've competed and participated in multiple game jams over the past few years and continue to practice my abilities when I can.
    This is a bit of C# development using the Monogame framework. I did not too long ago, that I ended up having to move on from due to school getting too busy. I intended to write 
    a 2D platform adventure game with a few friends, and at the time I was working on movement, some physics and the camera. I got the camera working quite well and implemented
    the ability to zoom in and out, with gravity being a little too strong for my liking. I also used this wonderful game background for development with some random colors and shapes.
    In this project, another progrmamer friend of mine Devin Benninghoven, developed the debug attribute and was working on a wave form collapse function for map development.
