            <p>In spring of 2024 I decided to sign up for Professor Powell&rsquo;s CSE 110, Software Engineering course at UCSD.
With a hectic start and not enough chairs in one of the biggest lecture halls on campus, we started the
course.</p>
<p>We were put into teams, and my team became Team Tungsten. This included myself and 10 other students.</p>
<p>The task we had been given was to create developer journal app on top of exams, long lectures, and some PAs.</p>
<p><img src="/obsidian.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We began to meet weekly and decided on a developer journal that would be modeled after the markdown
editor: <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a></p>
<p>While in the course, we began to learn more about agile development, CI/CD pipelines, unit testing and all
the good stuff when it comes to Software Development. So we decided to implement as much of this as we could.</p>
<p>We incorporated week long sprints and would review over the weekend and decide on the new tasks.</p>
<p>We decided to create a web-app using electron that would allow users ease of use when creating their journals.</p>
<p>Roles were designated to different people who wanted to learn different things, I was most interested
in the back-end so I started work on our markdown interpreter.</p>
<p>Doing research, I needed to find something that was easy to implement and powerful for our journal.
I looked at a lot of different tools and frameworks and ended up deciding to use <a href="https://codemirror.net/">Codemirror</a>.</p>
<img src="/codemirror.jpg">
<p>Codemirror was perfect; it offered markdown support with code-highlighting and an easy way to implement
the editor into websites.</p>
<p>I struggled a bit with this as I didn&rsquo;t have much experience with JavaScript but I was able to continue learning
and making mistakes to put in an editor with a custom design that fit in with the rest of our app.</p>

<p>This was a very meme-heavy course and our professor loved to share his own, so a lot of our project videos
were light and comedic which made for a fun final day. But my teammate Jesus create this video for our
group showing our app in action.</p>
<p>I learned a ton about teamwork and proper development from this course. Being able to organize a project like this
with as many people as we had was such a fun and challenging experience. I learned a ton about development and
how to think about the users and ensure projects have good accessibility.</p>
