# Welcome!

My name is Logan, and I'm a tech hobbiest with a degree in Mathematics-Computer Science from the University
of California, San Diego. I enjoy tinkering with old and new tech, making my own devices, programming, gaming
and exploring. I have done a lot in my young life and I am eager to learn and grow as a developer. Feel free to
reach out!
